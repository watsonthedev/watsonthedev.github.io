1. Assume good intent.

2. Listen first and seek to understand.

3. Clear is kind: dialogue driven by respect and honesty leads to better outcomes.

4. Diverse people from diverse backgrounds create better products.

5. All people inherently strive to show up, do a good job, and be proud of their work.

6. I often don’t have the answers; therefore, I elevate the voices of those on my team with subject matter expertise.

7. There are no easy solutions to complex problems, and most of the problems dev teams are trying to solve are complex.

8. The core tenants of the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org">Agile Manifesto</a> and the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">Agile Principles</a> are as applicable today as they were when first written over 20 years ago.

9. There are no “bad devs” but rather good devs in bad circumstances.

10. As a corollary to #9, I do not believe that devs should be labeled as “rockstars”, “ninjas”, “hardcore”, etc.

11. The hiring process should be humanizing and respectful.

12. People deserve to be not only compensated for their time but also respected as holistic individuals who exist outside the workspace.

13. A stable system requires periods of calm self-reflection; constant growth impedes sustainability.

14. Non-action can be a perfectly valid and active choice.

15. These tenets apply to myself as much as they do to those with whom I work.

16. Even seasoned pros occasionally code off-by-one bugs.
